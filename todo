- there is something wrong in the test_preprocess_input_images: When multiplying the image by the maski
  it seems that only one channel is multiplied or something like this... this has to be checked and corrected.
- Increase the code coverage in the possum/deformable_histology_iterations.py
- pos_wrappers todos.
- Update the virtual machine.
- Put all orientation presets into a single file
