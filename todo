- More elaborate comments in pos_sequential alignment.

- Increase the code coverage in the possum/deformable_histology_iterations.py
- additional tests:
    - reslice-interpolation sequential alignment test
    - pos_sequential_alignment - test registration ROI (also in pairwise alignment)
    - test invert multichannel
    - registration resize
- pos_wrappers todos.
- Update the virtual machine.
- Put all orientation presets into a single file

- some clever method to determine if given section is empty or if it does contain some non-background pixels
  (replacement for pos_wrappers.image_voxel_count_wrapper)
